         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>¶ The definition or deſcription of obligations and the cauſes thereof.</head>
                  <p>AN Obligation therefore is, the ſecond head, in which the right <note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> of perſons is ſeene: al whoſe ſubſtance conſiſteth not in this, that it ſhould make any body or ſeruice ours: but to bind another to vs, to giue, do, or performe ſome thing.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon an Obligation is defined the right of a perſon by which he hath an other perſon bound vnto him, to pay that he oweth.</p>
                  <p>And it ſtandeth in this point, that ſome thing be done or performed: And the ſame either a thing, or a perſon, and either the thing it ſelfe, or the intereſt or damage, or both together.</p>
                  <p>And all the doctrine of Obligations conſiſteth either in making of an Obligation, or in the diſſoluing of the ſame, when it is made.</p>
                  <p>The conſtitution or making of an obligation reſteth in the cauſes and maner of making thereof.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3453:7"/>
                  <p>The ſupreme cauſe (which is alſo common to all other effectes of law) is right, the inferior cauſe therof is the act of man, which rather giueth occaſion of thobligation, then induceth the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For although to the making of obligations, the mind &amp; wil of man be very neceſſarie, yet thereof ariſeth thobligation, not for that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wileth, but for that right &amp; fact granteth ſuch obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ariſe: And on the other ſide it happeneth often, that a man wil not be bound, and yet neuertheles is bound if he commit any ſuch thing by which right will haue him to be bound, as in Obligations with offences.</p>
                  <p>Right therefore is the chiefeſt cauſe of obligations, the fact of man the remote cauſe, <hi>ſine qua non:</hi> that, the principall cauſe, this, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is termed the bond of right, or law.</p>
                  <p>Of Obligations, ſome be ſimple and ſome mixt.</p>
                  <p>A ſimple or ſingle Obligation is that which leaneth vpon right onely, that is naturall right, or ciuill right onely.</p>
                  <p>Which ſo is either naturall or ciuill.</p>
                  <p>The natural Obligation is that whereby a man is bound to yeeld that only which he oweth naturally: And that is alſo called the right of the Law of nations.</p>
                  <p>A ciuill Obligation is whereby a man is bound by ciuill Law, to render that which he ought ciuilly.</p>
                  <p>A mixt Obligation conſiſteth of both lawes, naturall and ciuill.</p>
                  <p>In euery Obligation the one is called the creditor, or obligee, the other the debtor or obligor: And by diuers other more ſpecial names, according to the ſundrie formes of Obligations and Contracts: as feoffor and feoffee, leſſor and leſſee, grantor and grantee, donor &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee, vendor and vendee &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The creditor is he to whom any thing is due by obligation.</p>
                  <p>The debtor, he that is bound.</p>
                  <p>Such is the diſtinction of obligations by the efficient and original cauſe thereof.</p>

                  <p>A cauſe is a buſines which being approued by law, maketh the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation riſe by the contract, and the action vpon the Obligation.</p>
                  <p>There are two principall heads to bee obſerued in the learning of <note place="margin">Contractuum diſtributio.</note> Contracts: the one pertaineth to their ſubſtance or nature, the other to their adiuncts or accidents.</p>

                  <p>THe ſubſtance of al Contracts conſiſteth in conſent, as their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Sect. 11. Materia &amp; forma con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractuum.</note> and in the cauſe or buſineſſe as their forme,</p>

                  <p>For conſent is ſometimes vſed indeede, and ſomtimes fained, as in law: ſo of contracts, ſome be true, and ſome be fained.</p>
                  <p>True Contractes, be contracts hauing a true conſent ordained to <note place="margin">Contractus verus.</note> that end that the contract may be made, and therof an Obligation or bond.</p>
                  <p>Which true conſent is alwaies interpoſed of both ſides, whether it be expreſly or ſecretly: inſomuch, that if there be any error or deceit in the conſent or thing, for which the contract is entred into, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is either made altogether none, or of none effect.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3453:9"/>
                  <p>Therefore the true Contracts be thoſe, which are by mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both parties: which conſent is therefore interpoſed that the contracts may be, and that either both or the one may be bound ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and both thoſe thinges euen from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>But if you marke the end and effect of contracts, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">Contractuum eſt. ctus.</note> amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al, but al equally, aſwel fained as true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts breede obligations, which obligations ſo bred bring forth actions.</p>

                  <p>A particuler eſtate of inheritance, is an eſtate taile or limitted, that is an eſtate expreſſing in certain, whoſe iſſue, and of what ſixe ſhall inherite, and it is generall or ſpeciall.</p>
                  <p>A generall eſtate taile or limitted, is when the eſtate limitted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth not betweene whom the iſſue inheritable muſt be ingendred: As if the gift or conueyance be to a man &amp; the heire or heires males, or heires females of his bodie lawfully begotten, not naming vpon what woman: Or to a woman and to the heire or heires males or heires females of her bodie lawfully begotten, not naming the man by whom it ſhould be begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which caſe, euery heire of their bodies lawfully begotten may inherite, by what wife or huſband ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.

                  <p>An eſtate taile ſpeciall is, when it is certainly ſet downe betweene whom the iſſue inheritable ſhalbe ingendred. And this ſpecial eſtate taile is either expreſſed or implyed. An eſtate in ſpeciall taile ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed is, where it is ſpecially limitted what iſſue of the donee ſhall inherite. An eſtate in ſpeciall taile implyed is, where it is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpecially what iſſues of the donees ſhall inherite: as by gift in frankmariage, which is, where a man giueth lands with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or other kinſwoman, to an other in frankmariage, which word frankmariage amounteth to aſmuch, as if he had ſaid to the donees and the heires of their two bodies lawfully begotten, <hi>Litt.

Now may no iſſue take any benefite by that conueyance, but ſuch onely as are betweene them two lawfully begotten: And this maner of eſtate is properly called a ſpeciall eſtate taile: But if either of them die before they haue ſuch iſſue betweene them, then the partie ſuruyuing is vnproperly called a tenant in taile, and therefore for diſtinction fake, we terme ſuch furuiuor tenant in taile after poſſibilitie of iſſue extinct.</p>

                  <p>An eſtate of franktenement created by the operation of the law, is either by the common law, or by ſtatute. An eſtate of franktenement by the common law, is either dower, or by the curteſie of England.

                  <p>An eſtate of franktenement by the Curteſie, is an eſtate for the terme of life of the huſband in al his wiues land whom he ſuruiueth, hauing had iſſue by her borne aliue, which might by poſſibilitie if it had liued, haue had, and inherited the ſame lands of ſuch eſtate as the mother therein had, during the couerture.</p>
                  <p>An eſtate of franktenement by ſtatute is, either by vertue of a bond knowledged according to a ſtatute, or by reaſon of ſome execution.</p>
                  <p>A franktenement by Statute, is either by vertue of a ſtatute Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or of a Statute marchant.</p>
                  <p>A franktenement by vertue of an execution is, either by reaſon of ſome Iudgement in ſome of her Maieſties Courts of Record: or els by reaſon of ſome recogniſance: it is when the moitie of the Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſors lands be deliuered to the Recogniſee to hold to him as his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold til his debt be pated. But theſe eſtates of freehold growing thus by Statute, are not properly but vnproperly termed freehold.</p>

It is now time to enter into the diſcourſe of Inſtruments themſelues the verie proper matters and obiect of Symboleography.</p>
                  <p>An Inſtrument therefore is a formall writing made in paper or parchment, wherein are contained &amp; deſcribed contracts, couenants, laſt wils, or other facces and things of perſons for the teſtimonie or memorie thereof.</p>
                  <p>And firſt we ſay it is a formal writing to diſtinguiſh Inſtruments from ordinarie letters, priuate notes, reckonings, and remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made by any for a mans owne priuate vſe or memorie, and from all bookes of artes, hiſtories, diuinitie, philoſophie, and ſuch like.</p>

And ſometimes at this day vpon tables, ſtones, or tallies, none of all which kindes of writings we here meane, but ſuch onely as are made vpon paper or parchment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in ſaying that an Inſtrument co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted: it ſetteth before our eies, what the verie matters, buſines &amp; acts be, whereof ſuch Inſtruments muſt be made: namely of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts, grants, wils, pleadings &amp;c. which may breed Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, &amp; not of bare ſpeeches, communications, or priuate notes.</p>

                  <p>Fiftly, that which enſueth teacheth vs the verie finall cauſe why ſuch Inſtruments were firſt ordeined, that is, to the end the acts and things therein compriſed might both more certainly be kept in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and more eaſily to be proued: for the proofe of the Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts only proueth the Contracts therein conteyned.

                  <p>A publique Inſtrument, is an Inſtrument made by publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of a Magiſtrate or Iudge, as all grants &amp; charters of the Q.

                  <p>Such publique Inſtruments of their own natures proue the facts or contracts therein conteined, and are of ſuch &amp; ſo great credite of their owne natures, that they themſelues need no proofe at all.</p>
                  <p>Priuate Inſtruments, are Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts made between priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by the priuate authority of the contractors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out publique authoritie, wherefore although they being proued by witneſſes, or otherwiſe do proue the contracts &amp; facts of the parties therein me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned: yet of themſelues without ſuch proofe, they proue nothing, as deedes of feoffement, obligations, acquitances, wils &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3453:19"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Inſtrumentes be either of ſuch perſons as haue naturall capacity by birth, which euerie liege ſubiect being borne within her Maieſties dominion hath by his natiuitie.</p>
                  <p>Or by making, as euery ſtranger borne hath, being by act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament naturalized, or made a Denizen.</p>
                  <p>Or els of ſuch as haue only ciuil capacitie, as of all corporations or ciuil bodies, &amp; lawful ſocieties, colledges, guilds, fraternities, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies incorporate, as Maiors, &amp; communalties, bailifes, &amp; burgeſſes, deans &amp; chapters, Biſhops, Parſons, Vicars, &amp;c. &amp; al ſuch as haue ſucceſſion perpetuall, &amp; take to them &amp; their ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly inſtruments be either ſealed and deliuered, or not ſealed and deliuered.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly of their forme alſo, Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be either polled, and ſingle, or indented.</p>
                  <p>A polled deed, is a deed teſtifying, that onely the one of the parties to the ſame hath put his ſeale thereunto, after the maner following: <hi>Sciant p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſentes &amp; futuri quod ego W.

                  <p>IN the forme of euery Inſtrument it ſeemeth needfull to conſider <note place="margin">Sect. 48.</note> the ſubſtance therof, and of the adiuncts. Touching the ſubſtance, a deede doth conſiſt of two principal parts, namely the premiſſes and conſequence thereof.</p>
                  <p>The premiſſes of an Inſtrument is the former part thereof, and is commonly ſaid to be all that which preceadeth the <hi>Habendum</hi> or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of the eſtate.</p>
                  <p>In the premiſſes of Inſtruments are principally to be conſidered three things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, the perſon contracting, next the thing, matter, or facte whereof the contract is to be made, and then the wordes with which the ſaid contract is to bee deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The perſons are the very efficient cauſes of the Inſtruments, by whoſe conſent they are agreed vpon and made.</p>
                  <p>And the perſons to Inſtruments be either actiue or paſſiue.</p>
                  <p>The actiue perſon in Inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is he which maketh the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or which giueth, feoffeth, releaſeth, confirmeth, granteth, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, lendeth, deliuereth, letteth, departeth with, couenauteth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth any thing: or ſhortly hee which maketh any contract or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to, or with any other, and is named according to the contract: As the donor, feoffor, leſſor, obligor, releaſor, grantor, confirmor, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, lender, bargainer, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The paſſiue perſon in Inſtruments, is he, vnto whom the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be made, and which taketh thereby, who is likewiſe diuerſly named, according to the ſeuerall natures of the contracts, to or with them made.</p>
                  <p>In the perſons 2. things are to be heeded: The capacities: &amp; nams.</p>
                  <p>Touching capacitie, conſideration is to be had, that the actiue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which ſhould make any deedes be perſons able to do it: namely, that they be void of all impediments, either natural or ciuil: of which we haue intreated before amongſt contracts.</p>
                  <p>And the paſſiue perſons bee ſuch as bee capable of thinges which ſhould be giuen or tranſferred vnto them, and voide of the like impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and not dead perſons in law, as Monkes, Friers, Nunnes, and ſuch ſuperſtitious votaries.</p>

            <p>For as in Schooles in vaine ſhould chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſpend their time in learning the rules of Grammer, touching either the Etimology or Syntaxis thereof, if they did not after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their knowledge to the vſe of ſpeaking and writing.</p>
            <p>And as Phiſitions ſhould vnprofitably ſtore themſelues with the vnderſtanding of the ſeuerall natures and properties of herbes and rootes, and other ſimples, or of the Art of Phiſicke, if they did not ſhew vs, the vſe and fruit thereof in curing diſeaſes, and reſtoring health: So doubtles the doctrine of all other Artes and Sciences, is idle and barren if vſe and practiſe be not therewith conioyned. And therefore we alwayes accompt thoſe things which are wrought by art, of farre more paſſing excellencie then we doe the Art it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Neither doth any doubt that it is harder to practiſe an Art, then onely to learne the Theorike part thereof: For neither they which know the ſeuerall kindes and meaſures of verſes, with the lawes of verſifying, are thereby ſtraight wayes Poets: Nor they which haue learned by hart al the tropes figures and precepts of Rhetorike, are by and by Orators: for to their knowledge they muſt needs couple long vſe and exerciſe before they win the names of perfect Poets, or eloquent Orators.</p>
            <p>Euen ſo, it ſufficeth not for a notarie to know onely what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; contracts be, what things and acts they may be made of, &amp; by what perſons, with ſuch other general notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Which was ordeined at the firſt, that the common people might thereby haue notice of thalteration of ſuch eſtates, and ſo better know in whom the right thereof remayned, for their common quiet and repoſe. <hi>Perkins 209. 210. Bracton Lib. 2: cap. 18. Sect'. 1. 2. The</hi> vſuall maner of deliuerie of ſeiſin of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, lands or tenements is, that the feoffor and feoffee if they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or in their abſence, their Procurators or Atturnies (by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrants of atturney in writing) do come to the houſe or place whereof ſeiſin is to be deliuered: And there in the preſence of ſundrie good witneſſes openly reade, or cauſe to be read, the deed of feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and letter of Atturney thereof, or to declare the verie effect thereof before them in Engliſh. VVhich being ſo done, the feoffor or, his Atturney muſt take a clot of earth, or a bough, or a twig of a tree thereupon growing, or the ring or haſpe of the doore of the houſe, and deliuer the ſame with the ſaid deede vnto the feoffee or his Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſaying: I deliuer theſe vnto you in name of poſſeſſion and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of all the landes and tenements contained in this deed, to haue and to hold according to the forme and effect of the ſame deede.</p>
               <p>If the feoffement be without deede (as it may well be) then at the time of the deliuerie of ſeiſin, muſt bee expreſſed the very eſtate which the feoffee muſt haue thereby. In deliuerie of Seiſin, all
<pb facs="tcp:3453:112"/> perſons hauing any lawfull poſſeſſion or ſeiſin in the thing of which ſeiſin is to be deliuered, ought either to ioine together in the making of the Liuerie of ſeiſin, or to be remoued thence, as leſſees for yeares, or for life: for euery Liuerie ought to bring an immediate poſſeſſion vnto the feoffee, <hi>Littleton Sect'</hi> 61. &amp; 418. Alſo if the feoffement be of diuers parcels of lands lying in ſeuerall Townes in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Liuerie of ſeiſin in any part therof ſuffiſeth for all, if they be then in the feoffors poſſeſſion and out of leaſe. But if they bee in diuers Counties, or in leaſe, or out of his poſſeſſion, it is conuenient that hee enter into euery parcell thereof and make Liuerie of ſeiſin in euerie ſeuerall parcell thereof, for he can giue no poſſeſſion vnto his feoffee if hee haue it not in himſelfe at the very inſtant of the deliuerie of ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin made, <hi>Littlet<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. 18.

                  <p>In moſt humble wiſe complaining ſheweth vnto your moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Highneſſe, your Orator and faithfull ſubiect T. D. of Greyes Inne: That whereas one I. D. deceaſed Doctor of the Lawes, for the zeale and loue that hee had to his Countrey, and to the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bringing vp of youth in vertue and learning, gaue, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, confirmed, and aſſured certaine landes and tenements in the County of Y. of the cleere yearely value of fifteene pounds, aboue all charges and repriſes, vnto the Maſter, Fellowes, and Schollers of S. Iohns Colledge in C. to haue and to holde to them and their ſucceſſors for euer, to the intent, that they the ſaide Maſter, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and Schollers, and their ſucceſſors for euer, ſhoulde remaine and keepe in their Colledge fiue Schollers that had beene brought vp in the Grammer Schoole, freely erected by the ſaide I. D. in P. in your Graces Countie of Y. for euer, in ſuch manner and forme, as is is contained in a deede of compoſition quadripartite Indented of the ſaide I. D. bearing date the firſt day of September, in the yeare of our Lorde God 1515. and in the ſeauenth yeare of the Raigne of the late king of famous memorie Henry the eight, beeing made to the ſaide Maſter, Fellowes, and Schollers, as more plainely doth and may appeare. And amongſt the prouiſions, graunts, articles, and agreementes of the ſaide compoſicion it is contained, That the Maſter, Wardens, and brethren of a certaine Fraternitie and Guild in P. aforeſaide, founded there by the ſaide I. D. by the licence of the ſaide late King of famous memorie H. viii. ſhoulde alway when the ſaid Schollers roomes, or any of them fortuned to be voide by death,
<pb facs="tcp:3453:283"/> reſignation, forfaiture, or otherwiſe haue the election, nomination, and appointment of a Scholler, or ſo many Schollers as then might, or would ſupply the roome or roomes of the ſaide Schollers then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vacant or void in the ſaid Colledge. And that the ſaide Maſters, Fellowes, &amp; Schollers of ſaint Iohns Colledge ſhould alwaies giue knowledge vnto the Maſters, Wardens, and Brethren of the ſaide Guilde, when any ſuch auoydance ſhould happen to fall by any the meanes aforeſaide, within a certaine time appointed within the ſaide compoſition, as therein more plainely appeareth. And now moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne L. by reaſon of the Statute made in the firſt yeare of your moſt noble raigne, for the diſſolution of Chauntries, Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, free Chappels, Guildes, and Fraternities, although the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the matters of the ſaide Statute was not to hurt, alter, or change any ſuch good and godly foundations, made onely for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of learning, but rather to fortifie, augment and enlarge ſuch godly foundations and ordinances: yet that notwithſtanding, the ſaid fraternity and Guild onely founded for the godly intentes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, by the ſaide Statute made for the diſſolution of Chantries, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities and Guildes, as is aforeſaide, colourably vnder the pretence of Fraternitie ſuperſticiouſly vſed, is no we diſſolued and taken away, and by the meanes thereof the benefite and preferrement which the Schollers of the ſaid free Schoole in P. aforeſaide haue alwaies had ſithence the ſaid foundation made, is likely to be clearely gone and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, moſt contrary to the meaning and good intent of the ſaide godly ordinance &amp; foundation. And yet the ſaid Colledge of Saint I. at this day is poſſeſſed and ſeaſed of the ſaid lands &amp; tenements, giuen onely for the intents and purpoſes aforeſaide, which thing is like to enſue to the great diſpleaſure and loſſe of the inheritance of the ſaide Towne of P. and of all the Country there, vnleſſe it ſhall pleaſe your Maieſtie, that the ſaid godly ordinance may bee perfited, recontinued and eſtabliſhed by ſome good and godly deuiſe and ordinance. And whereas your ſaid Orator is ſeiſed in his demeane as of fee, aſwell of the Schoolehouſe of the ſaid free Schoole, as alſo of all the lands and tenements purchaſed by the ſaide I. D. Doctor of the Lawes for the maintenance of the ſaide free grammer Schoole, without any vſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, And no other deuiſe as yet made for the more perfit continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſaide free grammer Schoole, ſo that if your ſaide ſubiect ſhould chance to die, whereof he is moſt aſſured, it is not certaine that the ſaid lands ſhalbe imployed vnto the vſe &amp; godly intent aforeſaide, as heretofore they haue beene. <hi>May it therefore</hi> pleaſe your moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:3453:284"/> highnes, tenderly conſidering the premiſſes, that it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with the aſſent of the Lordes ſpirituall &amp; temporall, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, and by the authority of the ſame, in maner and forme following. Firſt that it ſhall and may be lawfull vnto the ſaid Maſter and Fellowes of the ſaid Colledge of Saint I. in C. and their ſucceſſors for euer, to nominate and appoint one diſcreete &amp; well learned man to ſupply the roome of the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of the ſaid free grammer Schoole. And that it ſhall be lawfull for the ſaide Schoolemaſter, with the Churchwardens of the Pariſh Church of P. aforeſaide, to nominate &amp; appoint one ſufficient learned yong man to be the vſher of the ſaid free grammer Schoole. And that as often as the ſaid Schoolemaſters roome ſhall fortune to be void by death, reſignation, or otherwiſe: that then it ſhall bee lawfull for the ſaid Maſters and Fellowes of S. I. Colledge. and their ſucceſſors for euer, to nominate and appoint one diſcreet and well learned man, as is aforeſaid, to ſupply the roome of the ſaid Schoolmaſter then being void. And in like maner &amp; as often as it ſhall fortune the ſaide Vſhers roome to be void by any the means aforeſaid: that then it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the ſaid Schoolemaſter &amp; Churchwardens, &amp; their ſucceſſors for euer, to nominate &amp; apoint one well and ſufficiently learned yong man to ſupply the roome of the ſaid vſher then being void. And that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaid Maſter and Vſher for the time being for euer, ſhall by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of this preſent Parliament be incorporated by the name of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Vſher of the ſaid free grammer Schoole of P. And that they and their ſucceſſors, ſhall haue perpetuall ſucceſſion in the ſame for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And that the ſaid Schoolemaſter &amp; vſher of the ſaide free ſchoole of P. aforeſaid for the time being, ſhall bee enabled by thauthority of this preſent Parliament, to receiue to them and their ſucceſſors in perpetuitie for euer, of the gift and grant of the ſaid T. D. or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon or perſons, landes, tenements, annuities, and rents of the cleere yerely value of xx. l.. and not aboue, for the exerciſing and vſing of the ſaid roome &amp; roomes of the Schoolemaſter &amp; Vſher, of the ſaid free grammer Schoole. And that the ſaid Maſter, &amp; Vſher, and either of them and their ſucceſſors, and the ſucceſſor of either of them, ſhall and may bee inabled by the authoritie aforeſaid to ſue and bee ſued, to implead and to be impleaded, for any matter or cauſe concerning the ſaid lands, tenements, annuities, and rents, or any parcell thereof, by the name of Maſter and Vſher of the ſaide free grammer Schoole in P. aforeſaid. And that from henceforth as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſaid fiue Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers roomes, or any of them within the ſaid Colledge of Saint I. ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:3453:284"/> fortune to be void by any the meanes aboueſaid: that then it ſhall and may be lawfull vnto the ſaid Maſter of the ſaid free Grammer Schoole in P. and his ſucceſſors for euer &amp;c. <hi>Nos autem tenores breuis &amp; actus praedict<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ad requiſition<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> T.

And that the life of man in this reſpect, is ſaide to bee for euer with him. <hi>Perkins Sect.</hi> 557.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing all the ambiguities and incertaintie of Willes happen chiefly through their obſcuritie in the wordes or ſentences thereof, it behooueth Notaries, and ſuch as write Willes, to haue ſpeciall care to ſet downe the Teſtators very ſenſe and minde very plainely, with apt and ſignificant words and phraſes omitting all ſuch as bee either hard to be vnderſtood or diuerſly to be taken.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that Willes being doubtfull, are alwaies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a benigne and fauourable interpretation, that if by any meanes it can, they may ſtand and be of force: for much better it is that Wils be perſpicuous of themſelues, then to be inlightened by the expoſition and allowance of others.</p>
               <p>Wee will therefore in this treatiſe, diſcourſe of ſome points of the doctrine and examples of laſt Willes and Teſtaments plainely and briefly, leauing preciſe and curious queſtions to be handled by others of better ſkill.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>¶ Of ciuill ſucceſſion, and what laſt Willes and Testaments be.</head>
                  <p>LAſt Willes and Teſtaments, are a kinde of Ciuill ſucceſſions. <note place="margin">Sect. 633.</note> For ciuill ſucceſſion is deuided into ſucceſſion immediate or lawfull, and mediate or teſtamentarie.</p>
                  <p>Succeſſion mediate or teſtamentarie, is when the perſon deceaſed made a will.</p>
                  <p>This hath his efficacie by law, and that by mans will which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth full ſtrength by and after the Teſtators death, and not before, and therefore is called a laſt will.</p>
                  <p>The other is called lawfull ſucceſſion, becauſe it hath being by the operation of law onely.</p>
                  <p>And the mediate ſucceſſion, is termed teſtamentarie (by Senecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che) for that a teſtament is the principall kind or part of laſt Willes.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it ſeemeth with vs that an Executor may be termed a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor teſtamentary, which is made by the laſt Will.</p>
                  <p>And an Adminiſtrator, a Succeſſor lawfull, which ſucceedeth him which dieth inteſtate.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3453:299"/>
                  <p>And for ſo much as while a Teſtament is hoped, there is no place for lawfull ſucceſſion, the doctrine of that ought to preceede this.</p>
                  <p>A laſt will therefore <hi>(vltima voluntas)</hi> is the diſpoſition or beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mans owne goodes and landes, taking effect after his death.</p>
                  <p>And it is Teſtamentarie or Codicillarie: namely which is made by Teſtament, or Codicill, or Scedule.</p>
                  <p>A teſtament is defined by moſt men <hi>voluntatis noſtrae iuſta ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, de eo quod quis poſt mortem ſuam ficri velit,</hi> for the perfiting of which definition, it ſeemeth good to adde theſe words, (<hi>cum executo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris inſtitutione</hi>) for without an executor there can be no teſtament, for thappointment of an executor is the true formall cauſe therof, giuing eſſence thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſome ſhortly define a Teſtament <hi>(haeredis inſtitutio)</hi> which is the naming of an executor, whereuppon we may ſay, a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is a iuſt ſentence, or declaration of our mind, concerning that which we would haue done after our deaths, with the ordaining of an Executor thereof.</p>
                  <p>Or rather a teſtament is a laſt Will, which of his owne nature in it ſelfe containeth a direct inſtitution of an executor.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of Teſtaments ſtandeth vpon two parts, the making and a deſtroying thereof, both which, and alſo the will of euery teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor are to be meaſured by the rules of the law.</p>
                  <p>The making of a Teſtament, is the right which giueth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or participation of the Teſtament. And this is chiefly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the perſons, and in the forme of the Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>And perſons are principall or leſſe principall: The principall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be the teſtator and the executor, leſſe principall be the witneſſes and legatories: Hereupon the making onely of a teſtament is actiue and paſſiue.</p>
                  <p>The actiue making of a Teſtament is which belongeth to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, that he haue right to make a Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>And the paſſiue making of a Teſtament, is that right which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the executor and other perſons leſſe principall in Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to bee made executors, legatories, or witneſſes thereof, to take ſome legacies or benefites thereby.</p>

                  <p>¶ We haue ſpoken of the perſons requiſite in Teſtaments: now <note place="margin">Sect. 637.</note> let vs view their forme or maner of making and publiſhing of them. The forme truely of making of Teſtaments, is the verie diſpoſition of the Teſtament rightly made, which is conſidered in the ſubſtance and inward forme thereof, and in the outward action of making and proofe of the ſame Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance or forme of Teſtaments conſiſteth in the verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and the ordeyning of an Executor, and in the thinges of which diſpoſition is thereby made.</p>
                  <p>The inſtitution of an Executor, is nothing elſe, but the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors naming and appointment whom he will haue to be his ſucceſſor in his ſtead to enter and to haue his goodes and cattels; vſe actions againſt his debtors, and to pay his debts and legacies ſo farre as his goods and cattels will extend.</p>
                  <p>And an Executor may be either of all the Teſtament, and then he is termed vniuerſall, or of part, as of plate &amp;c. and then he is named a particuler Executor.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the inſtitution of an Executor is pure or mixt.</p>
                  <p>A pure inſtitution of an Executor, is, when one or more Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be ſimply made without time or condition: for the Teſtator may aſſigne as many Executors as he will, being capable thereof, as if he ſay, I make A. B. mine Executor, or any other woords of the like ſence.</p>
                  <p>The mixt inſtitution of a Teſtament is vpon time or vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>Vpon time, as if the Teſtator make I. S. his Executor, when he commeth to full age, or from London, or while he dwelleth at L. &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:3453:301"/> and ſuch like referrences to time, as to make him executor during tenne yeares, or after tenne yeares &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Vpon Condition, as when the Teſtator appointeth I. S. his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, if he before probate of the teſtament find ſufficient ſuerties for the performance of his will, or with the addition of any other poſſible honeſt condition or conditions, for impoſſible conditions hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the pure making of the executors.</p>
                  <p>And as one or more Executors may be made ſimply or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, or with reference to time: ſo may Legacies and Deuiſes be made to one or moe ſimply or conditionally, or with reference to or from time.</p>
                  <p>And note, that although that in the aſſignation of Executors, and giuing of Legacies, and making of Deuiſes our law reſpecteth not ſo much the natural propertie and ſignification of words, as the true intent and meaning of the Teſtator, whoſe minde is the verie life &amp; ſoule of the teſtament: yet it is alwaies verie requiſite that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Teſtaments do expreſſe the ſame with as apt and ſignificant words as may be for auoyding of all ſcruples as may otherwiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by doing the contrarie.</p>

And againe a Codicill is either perfect or imperfect.</p>
                  <p>A perfect Codicill, is a Codicill hauing an oblique inſtitution of an executor: this Codicill reſembleth a Teſtament, and is in ſtead of a Teſtament of one dying inteſtate.</p>
                  <p>An vnperfect Codicill is an addition annexed to a Teſtament, and it is teſtamentarie or ſubſidiarie.</p>
                  <p>A Codicill teſtamentarie, is a part of the Teſtament, and an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſupplement thereunto, by which ſome thing is added to a teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſome thing detracted there from the teſtator for the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or amendment thereof.</p>
                  <p>A ſubſidiarie Codicill is inſerted into a Teſtament, to the end that if, that it be not of force by the right of a Teſtament, it may be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall as a Codicill, and is rather termed a Codicillarie clauſe then a Codicill.</p>

R. doe make and declare this my laſt Will and teſtament in writing, reuoking therby both in deed &amp; in law all other former wils &amp; teſtaments. <hi>Firſt</hi> I commend my ſoule into the hands of Almighty God &amp;c. Touching my landes, tenements, and hereditaments where I haue heretofore by my ſeuerall conueyances for thaduancement of my yonger ſonnes P. G. R. and F. the younger aſſured my manors of H. B. &amp; H. in the county of Y. And all my landes, tenements &amp; heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments in H. B. D. H. and B. in the ſaide County of Y. to ſuch ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vſes and intents, as in and by the ſaid ſeuerall conueyances are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: My will and meaning is, that the ſame aſſurances ſhall ſtande and be effectuall to the benefite of my ſaid children, according to the true intent &amp; meaning ſet downe in the ſame writinges. And I doe by this my laſt will ratifie and confirme, &amp; further doe will and deuiſe all the ſaide Manors, landes, tenements, and hereditaments to my ſaide ſonnes ſeuerally, and for ſuch and the ſame eſtates to them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly and ſingulerly as be mentioned &amp; limited by the ſaid conueyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And where in the aſſurance &amp; morgage concluded betweene me &amp; T. N. gen t<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I haue put my faithfull ſeruaunts T. B. &amp; R. C. in truſt, my will &amp; requeſt is to them that they doe performe &amp; accompliſh the
<pb facs="tcp:3453:307"/> ſame truſt, and doe make ouer ſuch eſtate and intereſt as they haue by the ſaid conueyance to my ſonne G. R. &amp; to his heirs males of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die according to my true intent and meaning, whereunto I haue made them pritty: for my full and plaine meaning is, that ſeeing the ſaid G. is my firſt and eldeſt ſonne by my late wife M. that therfore he ſhall bee remembred &amp; rewarded as a ſecondarie eldeſt ſonne, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall haue to him, and to the heires males of his bodie, my ſaide Manors of H. and B. and all my landes, tenementes, and heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in H. B. and D. Notwithſtanding my meacute;aning is, and ſo I doe hereby will and deuiſe, that his two younger brethren R. and F. may haue &amp; inioy the ſame ſeuerally during their liues either of them forty pound of &amp;c. by the yeare. And that hee the ſaide G. doe ſee the ſame paid according to my ſaid conueyance. <hi>And</hi> I doe further giue vnto my ſaid ſonne G. all thoſe Statutes, Recogniſances, and bonds, that the ſaid M. N. and Sir H. K. haue made and knowledged to me, or to any to my vſe for the performance of thoſe bargains that be paſt betweene vs, and I will that the ſame bonds may beſued in the name of my Executors but to the benefite of my ſaide ſonne G. and of his heires males. And if the ſaid M. N. doe pay the ſaide ſumme of &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon, and thereby doe redeeme his ſaide lands and inheritance in B. Then I doe giue and deuiſe that my ſaid ſonne G. R. ſhall haue the ſaide ſumme of &amp;c. to his vſe and benefite. <hi>Alſo</hi> I doe giue vnto my ſaid Sonne P. R. all my goods and chattels, ſtocke and houſholde ſtuffe whatſoeuer that ſhall bee and remaine at H. aforeſaide at the time of my deceaſe. And I doe further giue vnto the ſaide P. the one halfe and moitie of all the Leade that ſhall be owing me at the time of my deceaſe. And alſo the halfe benefite and forfaiture of all ſuch bonds as any perſon or perſons ſhall ſtand bound to me in for the deliuery of any lead or lead ore. And where I of very fatherly loue, and the rather thereby to allure him to his booke and ſtudy, did aſſure to my ſonne F. the elder by my firſt Wife, all that my manor of B. with the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and my parke and new builded houſe there, ſince which time I haue bin vrged by the great vnto wardneſſe of my ſaid ſonne (I wil not vſe any more bitter wordes) to reuoke and make voide the ſaid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and now haue giuen the ſaide manor of B. to I. R. my eldeſt ſonne, as by the writing thereof appeareth, in which reuokation I do proteſt before God I doe not knowe any manner of defect or ſcruple whatſoeuer, yet waying that <hi>Durum telum eſt neceſſitas,</hi> &amp; that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo peruerſus ſuſſitar lites,</hi> and laſtly, that the deſire of ſuch a Houſe &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:3453:308"/> Inheritance ioyned with any imagined title, will neither regarde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonition, nor brotherly affection: And to the intent alſo the ſaid F. my ſonne may haue ſome thing to maintaine himſelfe, &amp; apply his booke withall, if it pleaſe God that he may looke backe &amp; call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to an ordinary courſe of life, I doe therefore for theſe reſpects giue and deuiſe to my ſaid ſonne F. the elder, thoſe two rent charges of twenty pound a peece, amounting in the whole to 50. l. ꝑ annum, which I haue going foorth ſeuerally of the landes and inheritance of T. L. Eſquire, and W. R. Eſq. <hi>To haue</hi> and to holde to him for and during his naturall life. And my will is further, that if the ſaid F. my ſonne do giue himſelf to the ſtudie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes of this realme, whereunto I know he hath an aptneſſe by nature although through euill behauiour &amp; worſe company he hath ſhewed himſelf vnapt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and do become either Reader in Chauncerie or in Court being called thereunto orderly, and performing the ſame with good liking and opinion of the houſe, &amp; in proofe therof ſhal haue it ſo ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the handes and ſeales of fower Readers of Grayes Inne for the time being: Then I will and deuiſe the ſaid two rent charges of xx. l. to the ſaid F. R. and to his heires for euer. And I doe then alſo and not before deuiſe vnto him the Statutes, recogniſances &amp; bondes, which I haue ſeuerally of the ſaid M. L. and M. R. for the paiment and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſurance of the ſaid two rent charges or annual paiment, and the benefite and forfaiture which ſhall growe or bee by reaſon of the not paying therof, or by any other default committed by them or eitherꝰ, of them, their heires or aſſignes. <hi>Prouided alwaies</hi> that my ſaide ſonne F. do within one halfe yeare next after my death, if he ſhall not make the ſame in my life time, releaſe vnto my ſaide ſonne I. R. and to his heires for euer, all his right &amp; title that he hath or may claime to haue in the ſaid manor of B. and in or to the ſaid lands, tenements, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaments of the parke and new builded houſe in B. aforeſaid, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any the hamlets or villages adioyning therunto, with warranty to be therein contained againſt him and his heires for euer: And vppon condition alſo, that he the ſaid F. hath not charged or incumbred the ſaid manor and premiſſes in B. aforeſaid or any part therof, with any rent charge or leaſe whatſoeuer before the ſaide releaſe, where about three yeares paſt, I did in the name and behalfe of my daughter K. and for her better preferment, concluded and agreed with M. F. now deceaſed, for the payment of &amp;c. to my ſaide daughter in the ſpace of &amp;c. as by the writings thereof appeare, of which ſaid payment the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix
<pb facs="tcp:3453:308"/> of the ſaid M. F. hath well and truely paied vnto my handes, to the vſe of my ſaid Daughter the ſumme of &amp;c. due at the feaſt of &amp;c. laſt paſt, my will is, that if the ſaid ſumme of &amp;c. be not by me aunſwered to my ſaid Daughter in my life time: That then the ſame ſhall preſently be paid vnto her by my executor after my deceaſe. <hi>And</hi> my will is further, that if my ſaid Daughter K. cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by order of Law recouer and obtaine the ſaid ſumme of &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the intire ſumme of &amp;c. that then ſhe ſhall be paied and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the ſaid ſumme of &amp;c. or of ſo much thereof as ſhe cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the lands or goods of the ſaid maſter F. or at the hands of his executrix or adminiſtrators by my Executor, the ſame payment to be made within &amp;c. after my death. <hi>And moreouer</hi> I giue vnto my ſaid Daughter an hundred Markes, of &amp;c. to make vp her full and whole portion to the ſumme of &amp;c. <hi>And alſo</hi> I do giue vnto her the Chein of gold that ſhe commonly weareth, &amp; all her Iewels of gold, together with her late mothers Bracelets of gold, notwithſtanding my meaningis, that if my executor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

R. by conueyance in my life time the ſumme of &amp;c. when ſhe commeth to the age of &amp;c. or be married, together with her Iewels of Gold, and little Chein of gold which was her Mothers. And where I haue concluded with R. T. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for a Marriage (by the grace of God) to be had betweene his ſonne R.
